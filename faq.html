								<h2>What is HRV?</h2>
								<p>
								HRV is the phenomenon of variation in time interval between your heart beats. It's called heart rate variability (HRV). You can find more
								explaination and also further reading <b><a href="parameters.html">here</a></b>.
								</p>
								<!--<h2>Why should I care?</h2>
								<p>
								
								</p>-->
								<h2>Which devices are supported?</h2>
								<p>
								Find all <b>suported devices</b> <a href="devices.html">here</a>!
								</p>
								<h2>I have Android version 4.4 or higher but can't connect my device</h2>
								<p>
								You need more than just a phone with Android 4.4 or higher! You find all important informations <a href="devices.html">here</a>!
								</p>
								<h2>Is it indifferent what device I use?</h2>
								<p>
								The quality of the measured heart beats differ from one device to another. You can achieve best results by using a chest belt.
								If you use a device on your wrist check if the sensors are on the inside of your wrist. This improves also improves your measurement.
								</p>
								<h2>Why is the Baevsky Stressindex missing a unit?</h2>
								<p>
								The stressindex is a relative value. You need to observe it yourself. Best practice would be to make a measurement if you are stressed 
								(e.g. after doing sport) and another measurement if your are relaxed (e.g. after waking up). 
								After this measurements you'll have an upper and lower limit. At your next measurement you'll see if you are stressed or not.
								</p>
								<h2>How long should a measurement be?</h2>
								<p>
								Not every parameter needs the same measurement time. They can differ from each other to get the best result. We choose 90 seconds as 
								standard measurement time because we wanted to calculate not only one HRV parameter but give an overview about many HRV parameters. 
								Also we found that in 90 seconds we could get enough usefull data to calculate them. 
								You can do some research yourself and adjust the measurement time in your app. 
								</p>
								<h2>How should I take the measurement?</h2>
								<p>
								Do get the best results you should do your measurement always at the same time and in the same position. 
								Do not do one measurement sitting and another laying down. Even small changes like this can cause different results.
								Preferably you could do one measurement a day (e.g. in the morning) sitting.
								</p>
								<h2>Can I improve my measurement?</h2>
								<p>
								By doing your measurements always at the same time in the same position and trying not to move as much.
								</p>
								<h2>What is the meaning of the measured parameter?</h2>
								<p>
								An explaination of the measured parameters can found <a href="parameters.html">here</a>
								</p>
								<h2>What happens to my data?</h2>
								<p>
								Your data is saved on your phone and stayes there.
								</p>
								<h2>How a accurate are the measured parameters?</h2>
								<p>
								All of our calculations are based on scientific research. You can find a list of them here: TODO
								You can also export your measurements and compare with another HRV tool.
								You will find everything you need to know <a href="blog/articles/export.html">here</a>!
