								Since Version 1.2 you can export your measurements into your documents (dt. Dokumenten) folder on your
								phone. In this article, I show you that you can do more with your measurements than you may know.
								
								<h2>How to export your measurements</h2>
								<p>
								You may be found already the export feature. If not, you can find it in the settings. Just click on the export button
								and follow the instruction on the screen. If you connect your phone with your pc you can find all your measurements 
								in the documents folder. You can open one measurement with any text editor. One file should look like this:
								</p>
								<pre><code>0.8461
0.8130
0.7798
0.8296
0.8627
0.8793
..</code></pre>
								<p>
								This are your rr-intervalls of the measurement. You can now proceed and import them in another application to 
								calculate your HRV parameters again and compare them with HRV Band. 
								</p>
								
								<h2>Calculate your parameters with Kubios</h2>
								<p>
								Kubios is one of the applications out there you can import your measurement into and analyse it. 
								You can get it here: http://www.kubios.com/hrv-standard/
								Kubios is free for personal use but you need to provide some personal information to get an activation key for 
								the software.
								</p>
								
								<h2>Import Measurement</h2>
								<p>
								After installing Kubios you are ready to go to import your measurement from HRV Band into Kubios.
								To do so open Kubios and click on File -> Open or just press CTRL+O. In the opened dialog, you need to tell the 
								file manager to look for 'all files'. Afterwards select the measurement	you want to analyse. 
								Now your Measurement will be analysed by Kubios.
								</p>
								
								<h2>Why does the values differ?</h2>
								<p>
								You may discover that the parameters shown in Kubios may differ from the parameters in HRV Band. 
								This is because the way how misreads and signal noise is handled may differ in both and other 
								HRV applications. We try our best to handle this misreads and signal noises as best as possible.
								</p>
								
								<h2>Finally</h2>
								<p>
								Anyway, we still hope you will continue to enjoy HRV Band and we promise that we will try to improve our 
								calculations! If you want to be more certain about your HRV parameters use Kubios. 
								But you will notice that the differences are not as big as you may think ;)
								I hope I could show you another feature of HRV Band and how you can use it!
